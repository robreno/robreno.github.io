# Privacy Policy

UBViews, published by Agondonter Media, takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy I provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.


## Collection of Routine Information

UBViews does not track basic information about "users" at all. It does not track a "users" IP addresses or App usage details or timestamps. UBViews saves specific queries to a local XML storage file, but none of this information can personally identify specific "user". User queries are saved to the Local storage of the Windows App so that faster query searches can be facilitated.

UBViews provides the ability for "users" to add contact information for the purpose of shareing text quotes from the Urantia Book. The personal information saved to the Contacts XML file are name (first name and last name) and email address. These added contacts are used to share by email quotes from the Urantia text. Only the "user" can see this information as it is not shared with me or any Third Parties. 


## Security

The security of your personal information is important to [["us" or "me"]], but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.


## Changes To This Privacy PolicyThis Privacy Policy is effective as of July 13, 2024 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we  will update this privacy policy and post it here.
